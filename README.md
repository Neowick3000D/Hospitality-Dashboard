# Hospitality-Dashboard

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

Develop metrics per the provided list, craft a dashboard as per stakeholder mock-up, and generate additional insights beyond the initial metrics/mock-up to provide a comprehensive overview.
